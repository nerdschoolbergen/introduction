## Who?

All organizers are professional software developers with a passion and deep knowledge of the craft. We want everyone to be as enthustiastic about programming as we are, and we know that there is a steep and daunting learning curve when starting out. That's why we want to show you what we wish we had learned between school and starting our careers.
